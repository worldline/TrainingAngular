	Dependency Injection - DI Exceptions
</h2>

<p>
    As we told before, in order to inject a service into an other entity
    ( component / service / pipe ), <em>Angular</em> has to know
    which types are required by this entity.  
</p>

<p>
    And we also told that, to do that, <em>Angular</em> looks for <em>metadatada</em>
    associated to the given entity. Below is a transpiled component <code>Cmp1</code> which depends on
    the service  <code>Srv1</code>
</p>

<editortab title="test.js" fileType="js" [alone]="true">
var Cmp1 = (function () {
    function Cmp1( srv1 ) {
        // Transpiled methods and attributes are there
        // srv1 has to be injected
        // ...
        // ...
    }
    Cmp1 = __decorate([
        core_1.Component({
            selector: 'cmp1',
            template '&lt;p&gt;I am CMP1 &lt;/p&gt;'
        }),
        // These metadata tells angular which type has
        // to be injected
        __metadata('design:paramtypes', [srv1_1.Srv1])
    ], Cmp1);
    return Cmp1;
})();
</editortab>
