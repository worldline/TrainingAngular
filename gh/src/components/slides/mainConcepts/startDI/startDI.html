	Dependency Injection - Introduction
</h2>

<p>
    We have seen the basic types of elements available
    in <em>Angular</em>, and missed one of the important
    feature provided, the <em>Dependency Injection</em>.
</p>

<p>
   Basically, Dependecy Injection or <em>DI</em> also called Inversion Of Control or <em>IOC</em>
    is not specific to <em>Angular</em>, it's a common pattern used by many 
    frameworks and whose the goal is to minimize the modifications of code 
    when an implementation changes and to let the framework manage instantiations
    for you.
