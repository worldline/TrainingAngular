	Router - Configuration And Usage
</h2>

<p>
	Things to see in the previous example
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		The import of <em>RouterModule</em> from <em>@angular/router</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		The <em>routeDefs</em> array which defines our routes, where each
		route is defined by a path, and associated either to a component, either
		to a redirection to an other route
	</li>
	<li>
		The <em>forRoot</em> method which allows to configure our app
	</li>
	<li>
		Finally we use our directives:
		<ul>
			<li>
				the <em>routerLink</em> to go to a view
				by giving it the path to use
			</li>
			<li>
				the <em>router-outlet</em> to specify where our view
				will be loaded
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		You can see that our routing definitions are in a specific file, named
		<em>app.routing.ts</em>, this is not mandatory, but is a convention suggested
		by <em>Angular</em>
	</li>

</ul>
