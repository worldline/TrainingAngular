<ul>
    <li>As we told before, you can use <em>typescript</em> but it's not mandatory</li>
    <li>
        If you prefer, you can use js directly, but which version will you use: ES6 or ES5?
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you don't use <em>typescript</em>, we recommend using
                <em>ES6</em>. Writing <em>Angular</em> in <em>ES5</em> is 
                possible, but it will be a pain for developpers to learn libraries 
                whose the aim is to get functionalities which are native with <em>ES6</em>
                such as classes. And more generally, <em>ES6</em> is also there to
                make things more cumfortable (classes, array functions, templating...).
                The only use case for using <em>ES5</em> is people which don't want to 
                learn <em>ES6</em>, but this is not usual!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Remember that using <em>typescript</em> is generally interesting for most
    projects
