	<em>Angular</em> vs <em>React</em> - Main Differences
</h2>

<p>
	The mechanisms to detect changes are different, the one of <em>Angular</em> can be redefined
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<em>React</em>: Automatic Virtual DOM differences detection plus custom implementations
		to disable rendering of some components. The Virtual Dom is an "in memory" version of the
		DOM, once it's state change, an algorithm compares it with the real DOM and find the faster
		way to update the real DOM (so with a minimal number of operation)
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Angular</em>: On each browser event (js turn), the detection change algorithm is 
		called to check each component changes (<a href="">details here</a>) and can be strongly
		faster with good practices such as work with <a href="http://victorsavkin.com/post/133936129316/angular-immutability-and-encapsulation" target="_blank"> immutable objects</a>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Finally, <em>React</em> seems to be a little easier to learn
