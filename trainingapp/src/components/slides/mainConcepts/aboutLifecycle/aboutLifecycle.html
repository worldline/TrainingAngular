	About Lifecycle
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        You maybe noticed things such as <em>ngOnInit</em> in the code
    </li>
    <li>
        This is a method automatically called by <em>Angular</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        There are several other methods such as this one, automatically called at some points
        by <em>Angular</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        As a developper, you can use them when you need to do some specific things at some
        points
    </li>
    <li>
        If you use typescript, implement the associated interface before adding the method (just to be clean)
    </li>
    <li>
        The next slides about lifecycle are based on <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/lifecycle-hooks.html">the official documentation</a> : no specific notion here
    </li>
</ul>
