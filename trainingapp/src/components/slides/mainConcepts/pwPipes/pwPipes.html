	Practical Work 7 - Pipes
</h2>

<p>
	Let's work on the <em>books</em> page to manage the pagination and filtering books
	with help of pipes
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
    	On the form, use the <em>ngModel</em> directive to bind the input / select fields with some attributes in your <em>Books</em>
    	component
	</li>
	<li>
		Have a look at the existing <em>FilterFieldPipe</em> which is usefull to filter objects by field name:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Its input is an array of objects
			</li>
			<li> 
				It's waiting for 2 arguments: the field name on which it will filter and the value to filter
			</li>
			<li>
				Its output is the input filtered by the field and value specified
			</li>
			<li>Use <em>FilterFieldPipe</em> to filter your books by name</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<ul class="noliststyle">
			<li>
		Let's need to store the number of books filtered by name (which is so the total number of books if the name field is not used).
		To do so, we choose to create a filter, which takes an array of books as input, returns the same array of books, and just store
		the number of books in a service
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="imgs/updatedatapipefilter.svg" width="80%">
			</li>
			<li>
				So implement the <em>UpdateDataPipeFilter</em> and <em>DataContainerService</em> to store the data and use it in the template
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Have a look at the <em>OrderByPipe</em> pipe we will use to sort objects by field name:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Its input is an array of object
			</li>
			<li> 
				It's waiting for 2 argument: the field used to make the sort and a boolean to optionally reverse the sort order
			</li>
			<li>
				Its output is the sorted array of objects
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Use this filter to implement the "order by" functionality
	</li>
	<li>
		Add the <em>KPagination</em> component in your page to add the pagination feature:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<editortab [alone]="true">
&lt;kpagination 
	(pageChange)="yourMethod($event)" 
	[startPage]="yourStartPage" 
	[totalNbItems]="totalNumberOfItems" 
	[nbItemsPerPage]="numberOfItemsPerPage"
&gt;&lt;/kpagination&gt;					
				</editortab>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>startPage</em> specify ... the start page
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>totalNbItems</em> the total number of items 
						(in your case, it's the number of books eventually filtered by name that we have stored previously...)
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>nbItemsPerPage</em> the number of items per page
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Based on the page number, complete your previous filters with the existing <em>slice</em> filter in order
		to display only the elements needed for your page
	</li>
</ul>

<ul class="exercise">
	<li>
		As an example of what should happen:
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>[{name:'abc'} , {name:'bcd'}, {name:'cde'}, {name:'def'}] </em>
	</li>
	<li>
		filter by name with 'c':
		<em>[{name:'abc'} , {name:'bcd'}, {name:'cde'}] </em>
	</li>
	<li>
		sort by name and reversed
		<em>[{name:'cde'}, {name:'bcd'}, {name:'abc'}] </em>
	</li>
	<li>
		With 1 element per page to display the seconde page ( => slice:1:2 )
		<em>[{name:'bcd'}] </em>
	</li>
</ul>
