	Router - Introduction
</h2>


<ul>
	<li>Usually, navigate in an application means reload a new page based on a new url</li>
	<li>But remember that we are in a <em>Single Page Application</em></li>
	<li>So the router will take care of this behavior</li>
	<li>The router has its own API, it's not mandatory to use it</li>
	<li>And we didn't use it in previous samples</li>
	<li>
		It's a little bit the same idea than in <em>AngularJS</em> :
		views are mapped to url
	</li>
	<li>
		But with an important difference: the granularity of views, views can contains other views...
	</li>
