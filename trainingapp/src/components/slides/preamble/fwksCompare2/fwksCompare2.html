	Angular VS Polymer
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<em><a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/" target="_blank">Polymer</a></em> 
		is not really a framework, unlike <em>Angular</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Polymer</em> gives you a <a href="https://elements.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank">set of components</a> 
		and allows anybody to import them in its own application
	</li>
	<li>So <em>Polymer</em> is not really done to do SPAs, with stuff like routing and lifecycles features...</li>
	<li>
		It's more a library to make <em>Web Components</em> and can be used for example
		with <em><a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="blank">Meteor Js</a></em> in order to add framework features
	</li>
	<li>
		Finally, <em>Polymer</em> components can be used inside <em>Angular</em> applications as well...
	</li>
</ul>
