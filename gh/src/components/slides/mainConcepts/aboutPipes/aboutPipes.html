	Pipes - What is this ?
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<em>Pipes</em> are very similar to <em>Filters</em>
		in <em>AngularJS</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		But use the <em>filter</em> term was not appopriated
	</li>
	<li>
		They take an input and return something
	</li>
	<li>
		Optionally with parameters
	</li>
	<li>
		And have a custom syntax to be used in expressions: 
		the pipe character (|) 
	</li>
</ul>
