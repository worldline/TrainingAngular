	Angular VS AngularJS, what remains? 
	How to upgrade?
</h2>

<p>
	Some concepts remain, even if their implementation is fully different
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Template expressions, <em ngNonBindable>{{expression}}</em>, one way data binding</li>
	<li>2 way data binding can be simulated with help of events</li>
	<li>services</li>
	<li>The <em>directives</em>, even if it is a little bit different, now looks like kind of <em>Web Components</em></li>
	<li>Automatic change detection is still available, but is managed differently by the framework (events)</li>
	<li><em>filters</em> which are now named <em>pipes</em></li>
</ul>
