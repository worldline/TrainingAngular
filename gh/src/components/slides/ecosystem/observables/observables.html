	A word about Observables
</h2>


<p>
	Observables are kind of advanced <em>Promises</em> 
	and are used in <em>Angular</em> at different points
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The <em>EventEmitter</em> allows to emit custom event between components (let's see it later) and are based on <em>Observables</em>,
		(even if you don't have to deal with complex concepts to use it)
	</li>
	<li>
		The <em>Http</em> service returns an <em>Observable</em> to let you deal with an <em>http</em>
		request
	</li>
	<li>
		This way, we can say that <em>Angular</em> encourages to use observables, but don't force you
	</li>
</ul>
