	Dependency Injection - Introduction
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Once the typescript is generated into
        <em>ES5</em>, metadata tags are used in order
        to describe types needed to instanciate
        a class. 
    </li>
    <li>
        These metadata tags are then used by <em>Angular</em>
        in order to know which dependencies it needs.
        But this is a basic example, you will want to do
        much more sometimes.
