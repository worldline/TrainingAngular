    Practical Work 2 - Services
</h2>

<p>
    Let's play with some services, essentially <em>http</em>, 
    to implement our own  <em>NewsService</em> service.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>
        Have a look at <em>NewsService</em>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Test your dev directly on the main page
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete the <em>getNews</em> method by using the <em>http</em>
                service: method is GET &amp; url is '/api/app/news'.
                Be sure to keep an instance of news instead of call <em>http</em>
                everytime
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete the <em>addLike</em> method: method POST &amp; url is '/api/app/news/like/(news id)'.
                The post doesn't need specific data.
                Remember to update the number of likes on the local news when <em>http</em> answers successfully
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete <em>addNews</em>:
                method POST &amp; url is /api/app/news &amp; POST content is the news itself.
                Update your local news on success.
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete <em>deleteNews</em>:
                method DELETE &amp; url is /api/app/news/' followed by the news id.
                Update your local news.
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete <em>randomNews</em>:
                method GET &amp; url is '/api/app/news/random' 
            </li>            
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
