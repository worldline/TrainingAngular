<p>
    <em>Expressions</em> are almost like js, but are not:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The context is the bean ( access to the bean properties, 
        not global js variables )
    </li>
    <li>
        The <em>new</em> operator is prohibited
    </li>
    <li>
        As well as increment / decrement operators
    </li>
    <li>
        Bitwise operators ( | and &amp; ) are not supported
    </li>
    <li>
        Use filters in expressions with |
    </li>
</ul>
