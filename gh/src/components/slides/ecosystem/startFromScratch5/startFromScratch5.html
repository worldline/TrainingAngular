    A good way to test something with <em>Angular</em>
    is to use the <em>typescript.js</em> transpiler at
    runtime, because you don't need to install anything to use
    it. But again, if this is perfect for POCs, it's 
    not recommended at all for production purposes...

    Here is a <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/AkuQxM30cjJLATQ9A2zO?p=info" target="_blank">minimal application sample</a> :
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The index page is loaded</li>
    <li>Some polyfills are loaded</li>
    <li>The <em>SystemJs</em> module loader is configured</li>
    <li>At this point, everything needed to run an application is there</li>
    <li>The application starting point is loaded: <pre>System.import('app/main.ts')</pre></li>
</ol>
