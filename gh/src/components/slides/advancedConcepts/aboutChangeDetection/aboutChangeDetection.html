	Change Detection - Intro
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Change Detection is an important <em>Angular</em> feature</li>
	<li>And strategic also</li>
	<li>
		Because it can be costly, as it was with 
		<em>AngularJS</em> and its <em>digest cycle</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		The idea is to let the framework automatically update
		the view when something changes in the model
	</li>
	<li>
		As an example, you want to display the user name in your view.
		<ul>
			<li>
				You use the <em>$http</em> service to get the name of
				the user based on its login
			</li>
			<li>
				On the <em>$http</em> answer, you update the field
				<code>name</code> with the received value
			</li>
			<li>
				Name which is used in your view through the expansion
				<code ngNonBindable>{{name}}</code>
			</li>
			<li>
				And this works! But how <em>Angular</em> is 
				aware of the <code>name</code> field update?
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
